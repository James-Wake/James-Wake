		<h3>The Emerald Haven is Free Now</h3>
          	<time datetime="2022-1-20">Jan 20 2022</time>
		<p>
		  The Emerald Haven is now up on Amazon, Smashwords, Wattpad AND Offprint. There's also a link to download the epub file directly right here on this site on the "Works" page.
		</p>
		<p>
		The next book is coming along, working title "The Amethyst Dawn". It will be the third and final entry in the Sapphire Shadow trilogy, so get pumped, get hyped, leave reviews and ratings or just...you know...enjoy the story!

		<h3>More Links for The Sapphire Shadow</h3>
          	<time datetime="2022-1-10">Jan 10 2022</time>
		<p>
		  As promised, I've added new links for The Sapphire Shadow over on the "Works" page. It's up on Smashwords again, finally. There's also a link for a direct download of the whole book in EPUB form! Taking me a bit longer to get around to it than I would like but The Emerald Haven will be available in all the same places/forms soon enough.

          <h3>THE SAPPHIRE SHADOW is FREE Now</h3>
          <time datetime="2021-12-15">Dec 15 2021</time>
          <p>
            So here's the thing: My first book was free as long as you were paying for Kindle Unlimited. But I've cancelled its enrollment in KDP Select, so it costs ninety-nine whole cents now on Amazon no matter what.
	</p>
	<p>
	But!
          </p>
	<p>
	The whole reason I did this was so that I can post it for free wherever else. SO, if you click on over to my "Works" page, there are now more links by the book. It's up in its entirety on Wattpad and Offprint right now, and coming soon it will also be available on SmashWords. I just want to make sure the ebook is nice and cleaned up first. Said ebook will also be available to directly download, for free, from my website. The Emerald Haven will be getting the same treatment at the end of December when its KDP Select enrollment term is up.
	</p>
	<p>
	Obviously I really appreciate it if you love the book so much that you spend a dollar on it anyway. But I have no problem with the book being free and shared far and wide. Leave a review! Tell your friends! If you really really HAVE to give me money, there's a Ko-Fi link at the top of this page!

          <time datetime="2021-11-02">Nov 2 2021</time>
          <p>
            Went on a trip. Had a few weeks off there, just resting and getting myself together after working on The Emerald Haven for so long. Felt good, feeling ready to get back on the keyboard. The third and final book in the Sapphire Shadow trilogy isn't coming soon, but it is coming.
	</p>
	<p>
	Side note, I was too late to mention it in time, but HAPPY SPOOKY MONTH. If you click on over to the "Works" section, there's a link to some free short horror stories down at the bottom of the page. Enjoy!

                    Nadia loves jewels. Big ones, small ones, red ones, blue ones.
                    But her favorite variety is the illegally acquired. She has
                    more than enough money to buy the best. That’s never been the
                    point. Shoplifting is her hobby, her escape. When her high
                    school friend, Tess, offers to help her break into real
                    burglary, how could she refuse? Tess is a technical genius -
                    she designed and built her own right arm. Surely she can take
                    down any security standing in their way to bigger and better
                    loot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Outside the city walls, Jackson was raised in the slums. Life
                    as a refugee was never easy, and the only way out was joining
                    the army. Now she’s a cop, finally living inside the old sea
                    walls. She’s supposed to be hunting Cheshire, a reclusive
                    hacktivist stirring up unrest, but the nightly news is full of
                    a smug young woman breaking the law and getting away with it,
                    blowing kisses as she escapes police and private security.
                    Theatrical, daring heists, thrilling to watch. And Jackson
                    hates every minute of it.
                  </p>
  
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the city they both call home is slowly tearing
                    itself apart around them. Jackson crushes riot after riot,
                    just part of the job. But more and more it feels wrong,
                    hopeless, no point to any of it, no future for any of them.
                  </p>
  
                  <p>
                    Nadia has given up on the future. But more and more people see
                    her escapades and realize they can fight back. It doesn’t make
                    sense to Nadia, not at first, but an unlikely romance starts
                    to show her that there could be some hope, even in a broken
                    world.

                  <p>Nadia Ashpool was infamous as the elusive cat burglar the Sapphire Shadow, stealing at will and mocking the authorities in a series of dazzling heists. But her reign of fabulous terror ended in a spectacular arrest, and she’s been locked away in solitary for almost three years. When she finally escapes, her family comes after her with every soldier in their vast private army, stopping at nothing to end her little rebellion.</p>
		  <p>But rebellion is the last thing on Nadia's mind. Simply surviving is hard enough. Luckily she has the help of the genius cyberterrorist Tess Tanaka and Alice Jackson, a former cop turned renegade criminal. Together, they make a run for somewhere, anywhere, any safe place left at all in a world twisted by the ravages of climate change.</p>
	   	  <p>The city of Haven calls itself "The Safest City in the World." And it is. For some people. But there's no such thing as a safe place for people who would stand up for themselves. Sometimes you can't run and hide.</p>

                    A series of short horror stories about hunters of the
                    paranormal.
                  </p>
                  <p>Part 1 - The Gardener</p>
                  <p>
                    Two men arrive at a small town in rural Oregon. Children are
                    going missing. The forests are burning down. Panic is setting
                    in, and time is running out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    M and J might not be the brightest of hunters, but they'll do
                    what they can.
                  </p>
                  <p>Part 2 - The Unheard</p>
                  <p>
                    A solo hunter named Lilith leads a trio of teenagers to
                    confront a ghost in their high school. She never used to
                    believe in ghosts. Never used to believe in any of this. But
                    the facts were the facts, and she'd been fired for trying to
                    tell the truth.
                  </p>
                  <p>She isn't about to stop trying to protect people, though.</p>
                  <p>Part 3 - The Library Card</p>
                  <p>
                    Crosby is an old hunter. This isn't his first time seeing a
                    situation like this. People disappearing into a building for
                    days. None of them coming back. No way to know what's waiting
                    for him inside.
                  </p>

                  <p>Part 4 - The Waiting Demons</p>
                  <p>
                    There are demons waiting everywhere, ready to pounce on the
                    smallest sign of weakness. Mrs. Patience has always known
                    this, even before she became a hunter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now it is her and her husband's job to bring light to dark
                    places.

                  <p>Part 5 - The Slouching Beast</p>

                  <p>But something is hunting her.</p>
