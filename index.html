                    Nadia loves jewels. Big ones, small ones, red ones, blue ones.
                    But her favorite variety is the illegally acquired. She has
                    more than enough money to buy the best. That’s never been the
                    point. Shoplifting is her hobby, her escape. When her high
                    school friend, Tess, offers to help her break into real
                    burglary, how could she refuse? Tess is a technical genius -
                    she designed and built her own right arm. Surely she can take
                    down any security standing in their way to bigger and better
                    loot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Outside the city walls, Jackson was raised in the slums. Life
                    as a refugee was never easy, and the only way out was joining
                    the army. Now she’s a cop, finally living inside the old sea
                    walls. She’s supposed to be hunting Cheshire, a reclusive
                    hacktivist stirring up unrest, but the nightly news is full of
                    a smug young woman breaking the law and getting away with it,
                    blowing kisses as she escapes police and private security.
                    Theatrical, daring heists, thrilling to watch. And Jackson
                    hates every minute of it.
                  </p>
  
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the city they both call home is slowly tearing
                    itself apart around them. Jackson crushes riot after riot,
                    just part of the job. But more and more it feels wrong,
                    hopeless, no point to any of it, no future for any of them.
                  </p>
  
                  <p>
                    Nadia has given up on the future. But more and more people see
                    her escapades and realize they can fight back. It doesn’t make
                    sense to Nadia, not at first, but an unlikely romance starts
                    to show her that there could be some hope, even in a broken
                    world.

                    A series of short horror stories about hunters of the
                    paranormal.
                  </p>
                  <p>Part 1 - The Gardener</p>
                  <p>
                    Two men arrive at a small town in rural Oregon. Children are
                    going missing. The forests are burning down. Panic is setting
                    in, and time is running out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    M and J might not be the brightest of hunters, but they'll do
                    what they can.
                  </p>
                  <p>Part 2 - The Unheard</p>
                  <p>
                    A solo hunter named Lilith leads a trio of teenagers to
                    confront a ghost in their high school. She never used to
                    believe in ghosts. Never used to believe in any of this. But
                    the facts were the facts, and she'd been fired for trying to
                    tell the truth.
                  </p>
                  <p>She isn't about to stop trying to protect people, though.</p>
                  <p>Part 3 - The Library Card</p>
                  <p>
                    Crosby is an old hunter. This isn't his first time seeing a
                    situation like this. People disappearing into a building for
                    days. None of them coming back. No way to know what's waiting
                    for him inside.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No way to find out but to go into the old library himself.
                  </p>
                  <p>Part 4 - The Waiting Demons</p>
                  <p>
                    There are demons waiting everywhere, ready to pounce on the
                    smallest sign of weakness. Mrs. Patience has always known
                    this, even before she became a hunter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now it is her and her husband's job to bring light to dark
                    places.
                  </p>
                  <p>Part 5 - The Slouching Beast</p>
                  <p>Diana isn't a hunter. She watches. And she guides.</p>
                  <p>But something is hunting her.</p>
